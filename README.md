### Hi there. 👋 It's Alireza.

I'm an iOS developer 👨🏻‍💻 living in Iran.

Other than Apple platfroms related technologies, I'm learning server-side development with __Swift__ and __PHP__.

Currently working at __Map.ir__ as an iOS developer and a backend intern. I'm open to freelance and remote jobs!
